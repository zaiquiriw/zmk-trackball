With the solid technical foundation of Zephyrâ„¢ RTOS, ZMK can support a wide diversity of hardware targets.
That being said, there are currently only a few specific [boards](/docs/faq#what-is-a-board)/[shields](faq.md#what-is-a-shield) that have been implemented and tested by the ZMK contributors.

In addition to the basic keyboard functionality, there is some initial support for additional keyboard hardware:

- Encoders
- Displays
- RGB Underglow
- Backlight

Until detailed documentation is available, feel free to ask questions about how these are supported in the [Discord server](https://zmk.dev/community/discord/invite).

If you'd like to add support for a new keyboard shield, head over to the [New Keyboard Shield](development/new-shield.md) documentation.
